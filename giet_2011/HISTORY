    * 15/09/2009:
        The GIET entry point has been modified to comply with the MIPS32
        specification : 0x80000180

    * 5/10/2009:
        The syscall handler has been modified to comply with the MIPS32
        specification : the value stored in EPC register is the syscall
        instruction address => it must be incremented by 4 to obtain the return
        address.

    * 15/10/2009:
        The Interrupt handler has been modified to comply with the VCI_ICU
        specification : The IRQ index is obtained by a read to
        (icu_base_address + 16).

    * 26/10/2009:
        The interrupt handler has been modified to support multi-processors
        architectures with one ICU per processor.  Finally, the mfc0
        instruction uses now the select parameter to comply with the MIPS32
        specification when accessing the processor_id (mtfc0 $x, $15, 1)

    * 08/11/2009:
        The syscall handler has been extended to support 32 values for the
        syscall index, and to enable interrupts when processing a system call.
        Five new syscalls have been introduced to access the frame buffer Three
        new syscalls have been introduced to access the block device The two
        syscalls associated to the DMA have been removed.

    * 18/11/2009:
        The syscall handler has been modified to save the SR in the stack
        before enabling interrupts.

    * 15/03/2010:
        Replace the itoa_print assembler function by the itoa_hex() function
        defined in the syscalls.c file.

    * 10/04/2010:
        Modify the interrupt handler to use the new ICU component supporting up
        to 8 output IRQs for 8 processors.  The active IRQ index is obtained as
        ICU[32*PROC_ID+16].

    * 12/09/2010:
        The ctx_switch function has been included in giet.s to simplify the
        compilation process.

    * 25/09/2010:
        Add '.end' directive to end the _giet function and modify the 'sharp'
        comment character into the regular "slash asterix ... asterix slash"
        comment syntax

    * 27/09/2010:
        Respect stack convention with 4 minimum slots before calling C
        functions, for asm code

    * 28/09/2010:
        Save all the non-persistant registers in the int_handler.

    * 11/08/2011:
        Rewrite the giet following 3 major axes:
         - full separation between system code and applicative code
         - switch the most asm code into C code
         - restructuration and cleanup
